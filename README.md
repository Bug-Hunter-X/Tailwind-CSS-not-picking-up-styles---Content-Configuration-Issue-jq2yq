# Tailwind CSS - Content Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: the styles not being picked up due to incorrect configuration of the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js`.

**Problem:**
The `content` option in the Tailwind configuration file specifies the source files where Tailwind CSS should search for class names to generate the CSS output. If this array is incorrect or incomplete, Tailwind will fail to detect the classes you're using, leading to missing styles.

**Solution:**
Carefully review the `content` array to ensure it accurately reflects the paths to all relevant source files (HTML, JSX, TSX, etc.).  Using globbing patterns (`**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`) can simplify the process.
